# Fiz Trivia Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2, 2026**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Fiz collects, uses, and protects user information while maintaining our commitment to user privacy and data security.

## Core Privacy Commitment

We cannot access your game data. All progress, streaks, answered questions, preferences, and leaderboard entries stay locally on your device, remaining completely inaccessible to the app developers.

## Information Collection

### Game Data (Local Storage Only)

The following data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework:

Optional analytics help us:

## Data Sharing

**We do not sell, trade, or share your data.**

The only third-party service with potential access to data is:
- **PostHog:** GDPR-compliant analytics platform that receives anonymous usage statistics only when you enable analytics

## Data Security

**Local Storage:** All game data benefits from iOS device encryption and remains on your device under your control.

**No Cloud Transmission:** Game progress, streaks, and preferences are never transmitted to remote servers.

**Apple IAP Security:** Expansion pack purchases are secured through Apple's In-App Purchase system.

**Device Access:** Data remains accessible only through your device's unlock mechanisms (Face ID, Touch ID, passcode).

## User Rights

You have complete control over your data:

**Access:** View all data through the app (leaderboard, question history, settings)

**Delete:**
- Reset individual category/topic progress through settings
- Clear all game progress through "Reset All Progress" option
- Remove all data by uninstalling the app

**Export:** Data remains on your device and is included in standard iOS backups

**Analytics Control:** Enable or disable analytics at any time in settings. Disabling analytics clears any previously collected data.

**Phobia Filters:** Add or remove content filters for specific topics at any time

## Children's Privacy

Fiz does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app:
- Does not require user accounts
- Does not collect personal identification
- Does not enable communication with other users
- Stores all data locally on the device

Parents should monitor their children's use of in-app purchases and can use Screen Time restrictions to control purchases.

## Data Retention

**Local Data:** Remains on your device until you delete it through the app or uninstall the app.

**Analytics:** When enabled, PostHog retains anonymous usage data according to their retention policies. No personal information or game content is included.

**Purchase History:** Managed by Apple through your Apple ID according to Apple's policies.

## Third-Party Services

### Apple Services

**SwiftData/Core Data:** Local database framework that stores data on your device

**StoreKit:** In-App Purchase system for expansion packs (governed by Apple's privacy policy)

**Family Sharing:** Allows sharing of purchases with family members (governed by Apple's privacy policy)

### PostHog (Optional Analytics)

**Privacy-Focused:** GDPR-compliant analytics platform

**Opt-Out Default:** Not active unless you enable analytics in settings

**Anonymous Data:** No personal identifiers or game content collected

**User Control:** Can be disabled at any time, which clears stored data

## International Users

Since all data is stored locally on your device and not transmitted to remote servers:
- Data remains in your physical possession
- No international data transfers occur
- Optional analytics (if enabled) may process data in the United States, but contain no personal information or game content

## Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be indicated by:
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top
- Providing in-app notices for material changes
- Continued use after changes indicates acceptance

## Legal Rights

### California Residents (CCPA)

You have the right to:
- **Know:** What personal information is collected (locally stored only, not transmitted)
- **Delete:** Remove all local data by uninstalling or using in-app reset options
- **Opt-Out:** We do not sell personal information

### European Users (GDPR)

You have the right to:
- **Access:** View all your data through the app
- **Rectification:** Modify settings and preferences
- **Erasure:** Delete data through app reset or uninstall
- **Portability:** Data is included in iOS backups
- **Object:** Disable analytics at any time

Since we don't collect or store your game data on remote servers, you maintain full control through the app and device.

## Data Breach Response

In the unlikely event of a security incident:
- We will investigate promptly
- Notify affected users if personal data is compromised
- Implement preventive measures

**Note:** Since game data is stored locally on your device and not on our servers, the risk of a data breach affecting your game progress is minimal. Your data security primarily depends on your device security (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID).

## Backup and Recovery

**User Responsibility:** We recommend:
- Regular iOS device backups (iTunes or iCloud)
- Protecting your device with a passcode
- Enabling Find My iPhone for device security

**Limitations:** We cannot recover lost game data if your device is lost, damaged, or if you uninstall without backup.
