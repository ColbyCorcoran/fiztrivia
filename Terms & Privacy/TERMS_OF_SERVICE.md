## 3. User Data and Storage

**Local Storage:** All game data (streaks, answered questions, preferences, leaderboard) is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework, remaining under your control.

**No Cloud Sync:** Fiz does not sync data across devices. All progress remains on the device where the app is installed.

## 4. In-App Purchases

**Expansion Packs:** Optional content packs are available for purchase through Apple's In-App Purchase system.

## 6. Analytics

**Family-Friendly Content:** All trivia questions are designed to be appropriate for general audiences.

## 8. Question Content

**Accuracy:** While we strive for factual accuracy, trivia questions are for entertainment purposes and should not be considered authoritative educational content.

**Updates:** Question database may be updated periodically to improve accuracy or add new content.

**Expansion Packs:** Additional question content is available through optional purchases and follows the same accuracy standards.

## 9. Intellectual Property
