## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Identify Which Questions to Keep
For each topic, select 10 (or 20 for sports) questions:
- Mix of difficulties (some easy, some medium, some hard)
- Representative of the topic
- Don't need to be the "best" - variety is more important

### Step 2: Create Expansion Document
- Create `questions_expansions.json`
- Structure: Same as main database but with topics as keys
- Questions get new IDs starting at X01

### Step 3: Remove Expansion Questions from Base Game
- Remove selected questions from `questions.json`
- Keep only 10/20 questions per topic
- Base game maintains variety but lighter on specific topics

### Step 4: Verify Counts
- Base game: 1,618 questions after reduction
- Expansion file: 287 questions
- Total preserved: 1,905 questions (no data loss)

---

## Files to Create

1. **questions_expansions.json** - Expansion pack questions
   ```json
   {
     "expansion_packs": {
       "pixar": [...],
       "star_wars": [...],
       "marvel": [...],
       "dc": [...],
       "the_office": [...],
       "harry_potter": [...],
       "pokemon": [...],
       "sports": {
         "basketball": [...],
         "american_football": [...],
         ...
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **EXPANSION_MAPPING.md** - Documentation of which questions went where

---

**Ready to proceed?** Once you approve this plan, I'll:
1. Create a script to select which questions to keep (10/20 per topic)
2. Move the remaining questions to expansion file with new IDs
3. Update the base game database
4. Create the expansion questions file
